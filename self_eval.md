# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I feel like I have a much better understanding of comparison.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? I feel that I have a good understanding of logical operators.  
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I feel like I have a better understanding of if statements but still need more practice and research to be fluent.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? I spend a lot of time on this lesson and went over the time I assigned for it. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I still need to practice writing longer if statements and the operators that I need to use.  I will get better by review my lesson and using google to search up some of my questions. I will need to adjust my calender since I spend too much time on this lesson today.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? For now I'm okay with the lesson but will search up more information about the lesson today.
